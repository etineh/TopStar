## 🎯 What I Learned

This project was a major milestone during my learning journey. I gained practical experience in:

* Integrating Android apps with a Spring Boot backend.
* Implementing live chat and video call features for real-time user interaction.
* Managing user sessions and handling authentication securely.
* Designing user-friendly interfaces and navigating between screens effectively.
* Loading and displaying images efficiently, and handling network-based data.
* and lot more!

## 🔧 What I’d Improve if Rebuilding Today

If I were to rebuild this project today:

* I’d structure the app using **MVVM architecture**, separating UI, business logic, and data layers.
* I’d adopt **Jetpack components** like ViewModel, LiveData, and Navigation Component.
* I’d implement the **Repository pattern** to decouple data sources.
* I’d introduce **Dependency Injection** using Hilt for cleaner and testable code.
* I’d write **unit tests** and **UI tests** to ensure better reliability and scalability.
* I’d complete the **multiplayer game part** to enhance app fun.

## 🧠 Final Note

Though this app was built while I was still learning, it reflects my foundation in mobile app development. Today, I write production-grade apps using modern Android architecture with Kotlin or Java, and I’m confident in applying best practices for scalable and maintainable code.
