## üéØ What I Learned

This project was a major milestone during my learning journey. I gained practical experience in:

* Connecting Android apps to Firebase backend.
* Managing user sessions and data.
* Building user interfaces and handling app navigation.
* Handling images and network-based data.

## üîß What I‚Äôd Improve if Rebuilding Today

If I were to rebuild this project today:

* I‚Äôd structure the app using **MVVM architecture**, separating UI, business logic, and data layers.
* I‚Äôd adopt **Jetpack components** like ViewModel, LiveData, and Navigation Component.
* I‚Äôd implement the **Repository pattern** to decouple data sources.
* I‚Äôd introduce **Dependency Injection** using Hilt for cleaner and testable code.
* I‚Äôd write **unit tests** and **UI tests** to ensure better reliability and scalability.

## üß† Final Note

Though this app was built while I was still learning, it reflects my foundation in mobile app development. Today, I write production-grade apps using modern Android architecture with Kotlin or Java, and I‚Äôm confident in applying best practices for scalable and maintainable code.
